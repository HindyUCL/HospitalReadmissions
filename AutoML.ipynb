    "AutoML works through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is a critical step where raw data is transformed into features that can improve the predictive power of a model. AutoML handles this automatically:\n",
    "\t•\tImputation: Automatically fills missing values (e.g., mean, median, mode, or advanced techniques like k-NN).\n",
    "\t•\tEncoding: Converts categorical variables into numeric formats (e.g., one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding, or embeddings).\n",
    "\t•\tScaling: Normalizes or standardizes numerical features for better model performance.\n",
    "\t•\tTransformation: Applies logarithmic transformations, polynomial features, or feature interactions.\n",
    "\t•\tText Embedding: Automatically converts text data into embeddings using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or pre-trained language models like BERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoML tools evaluate the importance of each feature and select the most relevant ones by:\n",
    "\t•\tRemoving redundant, highly correlated, or irrelevant features.\n",
    "\t•\tRanking features by their contribution to model performance.\n",
    "\t•\tUsing techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or tree-based feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Automated Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoML iteratively trains multiple models using different algorithms and hyperparameter combinations. For feature engineering:\n",
    "\t•\tIt generates new features, evaluates their utility, and includes them if they improve the model.\n",
    "\t•\tIt evaluates the performance of engineered features using cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Pipeline Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire workflow, from preprocessing to feature engineering and model evaluation, is handled as a pipeline. This ensures that all steps (e.g., imputation, encoding) are consistently applied during training and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Use AutoML for Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "You can leverage popular AutoML tools like H2O AutoML, Google Cloud AutoML, or libraries like Auto-sklearn and PyCaret in Python. "
