Data Transformation & Exploration: 

- Dataset merging
- Assign numerical values to placeholder values in the fields
- Balancing the data
- Resampling if needed (for categories with few observations)
- PCA to select teh most important features
- Impute using semantic culstering for (text data) and clustering for numbers
- Feature engineering (create new features out of other columns)

- Summary of Stats
- Imputation
- Distribution plots for features
- AutoML for feature engineering
- Manual feature engineering

Preparation for training: 
- shuffle the data
- split in train, validation, and test sets
- make sure all are balanced in terms of categories

Model Tested: 
- Logistic Regression
- LightGBM
- XGBoost
- random Forest (not used because lacks explanability)

Model created: (creative part using keras or PyTorch)
- Super learners out of trees and linear regressors
- ...

Evaluation Metrics and Plots:

- Confusion Matrix with particular ephasis False Negative, etc.
