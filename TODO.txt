- Fix the problem of Train, Validation, and test 
- Double check whether the LASSO and PCA steps are good for performance, is it necessary to do it? 
- Double check how the temporal datasets are created 
- Double chekc why the LSTM model is not performing very well
- Feature Engineer a "number_previous_readmissions" and average each other column, using a geometric average" and then retrain the best models and see how they do.
